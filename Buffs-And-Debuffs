*Overwatted*: *Overwatted* is a Negative Debuff gained through **Overwatt**. If a character is *Overwatted* then the number of **Watts** available next turn decreases by the value of how much the card went over the **Watts** limit. (E.g, If [Attack 1] and [Debuff 2] use 4 of the avaliable 6 **Watts**, and [Buff 3] uses 3 **Watts**, then the player will only be able to use 5 **Watts** and CAN’T **Overwatt** on their next turn.) Additionally, the character with the *Overwatted* Debuff will take +1 additional damage until the player’s next turn.
