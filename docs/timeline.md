### Team Allocation

The first decision made on the project was to ensure that everyone's creative ideas are welcomed here and fostered to promote professional development and growth since the project aims to improve our experience and development portfolios.

Following a brief team discussion, we settled on the following team allocations:

| Name          | Role                      |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Thomas Pullan | Project Lead & Programmer |
| Mason Bennett | Logic Programmer & Tester |
| Anna Saunders | GFX & Tester              |

### Project Management

The Project initialisation involved first creating guide documentation such as a README file and a Style guide to inform people on how to properly contribute to the code of the project.

Following some research from previous projects, I devised a styleguide to use proper styling techniques using simple and useful commit and programming strategies.
