### Team Allocation
The first decision made on the project was to ensure that everyone's creative ideas are welcomed here and fostered to promote professional development and growth since the project aims to improve our experience and development portfolios.

Following a brief team discussion, we settled on the following team allocations:
| Name          | Role                      |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Thomas Pullan | Project Lead & Programmer |
| Mason Bennett | Programmer & Tester       |
| Anna Saunders | GFX & Tester              |
